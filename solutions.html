    <h3>Integrating Multiple Legacy Systems</h3>

    <p>Business combinations make economic sense when scale and product alignment synergies result in a merged organization that is more profitable than the formerl independent companies.
        Afterwards, however, transformation projects that move the acquired group's process off their legacy system onto the other's system are often needed.
        <br>
        Companies often find it difficult to sacrifice the staff's time in a way that would enable them to succeed at these deeper, synergy challenges.
        These companies relize that thy cannot afford to dedicate their best and brightest prople to technology transformation projects and still succeed in meeting normal operational goals.
        However, IT managers must address the issue; otherwise they will risk running a patchwork of duplicate systems that will grow with each subsequent acquisition.
        <br>
        If you have multiple legacy systems performing the same process for seperate pieces of your company, The Casey Group can help.
        We can conduct our Full IT Business Processing Assessment and help you formulate a horizaon view (based on your business strategy, growth aspirations and competitive environment) of what you ultimately want your processes and related systems to be.
        <br>
        Next, we work with you to creatively design a series of realistic changes that move you from your current situation through one or more workable interim states.
        At The Casey Group, we leverage our extensive experience in integreating legacy applications to plan an execute successsful interim states for our clients.
        These interim solutions bridge the data and user experience of the multiple legacy processes onot a single view of information and common transactional process while the new bridge solution continues to interact with the underlying legacy application in the background.
        Afterwards, we move on to your horizon view.
        <br>
        The completion of workable interim states and attainment of your horizon view involves our System Integration services and Application Development services.

    <h3>Increasing Market Share</h3>

    <p>The IT organization, working with the business managers in the front lines, can have a tremendous impact on enabling the company to capture market sharte in its existing markets or to successfully enter new markets.
        Technology can be used to cost-effectively gather and analyze feedback about customer satisfaction.
        It can be leveraged to improve apparently mundane, but suprisingly important, aspects of the customer experience such as invoicing information, self-service account management and enhanced cash settlement options.
        Technology can be employed to provide customer relations staff with the immediate access to information they need to address a broad range of customer questions and concerns in the fairly brief timeframe permissible in the mind of a confused, impatient or frustrated customer.
        <br>
        The Casey Group can help you leverage technology in these areas and others to improve your custmers buying or service experience.
        <br>
        The most radical impacts of IT on competitiveness are achieved when technologies are used to reduce the quantity of people and materials required to convert resources in products and to get those products into the hands of customers.
        The Casey Group has the Senior Leadership experience and a strong roster of technology experts to help you leverage technology to both reduce costs and enhance your customers experience, which will put you in a better position to capture market share.

    <h3>Providing Field Staff with Access to Enterprise Data</h3>

    <p>The advent of smart mobile devices is creating opportunities for your sales team, field technicians, transportation crews, and customer service reps (and perhaps even your customer directly) to access enterprise data as they move about outside your walls (and outside your firewalls) transacting your business.
        If you don't identify and address those opportunities, your competitors certainly will.
        <br>
        However, changes are so rapid that industry standards are not yet coalescing and technolgoies that were impressive a year ago are soon to be superseded.
        In addition, these are concerns about the risk of possibly exposing enterprise data to unintended viewers.
        <br>
