    <h3>Integrating Multiple Legacy Systems</h3>

    <p>Business combinations make economic sense when scale and product alignment synergies result in a merged organization that is more profitable than the formerl independent companies.
        Afterwards, however, transformation projects that move the acquired group's process off their legacy system onto the other's system are often needed.
        <br>
        Companies often find it difficult to sacrifice the staff's time in a way that would enable them to succeed at these deeper, synergy challenges.
        These companies relize that thy cannot afford to dedicate their best and brightest prople to technology transformation projects and still succeed in meeting normal operational goals.
        However, IT managers must address the issue; otherwise they will risk running a patchwork of duplicate systems that will grow with each subsequent acquisition.
        <br>
        If you have multiple legacy systems performing the same process for seperate pieces of your company, The Casey Group can help.
        We can conduct our Full IT Business Processing Assessment and help you formulate a horizaon view (based on your business strategy, growth aspirations and competitive environment) of what you ultimately want your processes and related systems to be.
        <br>
        Next, we work with you to creatively design a series of realistic changes that move you from your current situation through one or more workable interim states.
        At The Casey Group, we leverage our extensive experience in integreating legacy applications to plan an execute successsful interim states for our clients.
        These interim solutions bridge the data and user experience of the multiple legacy processes onot a single view of information and common transactional process while the new bridge solution continues to interact with the underlying legacy application in the background.
        Afterwards, we move on to your horizon view.
        <br>
        The completion of workable interim states and attainment of your horizon view involves our System Integration services and Application Development services.
