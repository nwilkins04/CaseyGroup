    <h2>Integrating Multiple Legacy Systems</h2>
    <p>Business combinations make ecomonic sense when scale and product alignment synergies results in a merged organization that is more profitable than the formerly independent companies.
        Afterwards however, transformation projects that move the aquired group's process off their legacy system onto the other's system are often needed.
        <br>
        Companies aften find it difficult to sacrifice the staff's time in a way that would enable them to succeed at these deeper, synergy challenges.
        These companies realize that they cannot afford to dedicate their best and brightest people to technology transformation projects and still succeed in meetin normal operational goals.
        However, IT managers must address this issue, otherwise they will risk running a patchwork of duplicate systems that will grow each subsequent acuisition.
        <br>
        If you have multiple legacy systems performing the same process for separate pieces of your comapny.
        The Casey Group can help.
        We can conduct our Full IT Business Processing Assessment and help you formulate a horizon view (based on your business strategy, growth aspirations and competitive environment) of what you ultimately want your processes and related systems to be.
        <br>
        Next, we work with you to creatively deisgn a series of realistic changes that move you from your current situation through one or more workable interim states.
        At The Casey Group, we leverage our extensive experience in integrating legacy applications to plan and execute successful interim states for our clients.
        These interim solutions bridge the data and user experience of the multiple legacy processes onto a single view of information and common transactional process while the new bridge solutions continues to interact with the underlying application in the background.
        Afterwards, we move on to your horizon view.
