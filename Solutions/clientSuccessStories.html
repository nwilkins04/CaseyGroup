        Service: Legacy Systems Management
    </h2>

    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <p>A leading fire and security firm that provides monitoring systems for the commercial and residential business markets wanted to focus its attention on the continues growth and development of its business.
        As a result, it wanted to use its internal IT resources for focusing on new initiatives and business development.
        <br>
        The company has an IBM mainframe and websphere environment.
        These environments run key strategic functions such as order to cash processing, sales management, accounts receivables, customer call center applications and document management processing.

    <h2>Fire and Security Firm (Fortune 500)
        <br>
        Service: Custom Application Development
    </h2>

    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <p>A leading fire and security firm that provides monitoring systems for the commercial and residential business markets was managing its documents manually which was intensive, error prone, costly, and exceedingly slow in document turn around.
        Also, to reduce costs and gain improvised operational efficiencies, the company wanted to consolidate its operations.
    </p>

    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>The company chose our custom application development servce to develop its document management system.
        Based on the client's specifications and out IT assessment, we developed solutions that resulted in significant improvements in its document management processes.
        <br>
        The client's document management system was part of a four year order to cash re-engineering program that the company had engaged The Casey Group to lead.
        For the document management system, The Casey Group worked closely with the client in devising the automated scanning and workflow processes for handling the multitude of contracts and order documents.
        The design called for the information to be maintained in a content management database where it is electroncially stored and can be searched and retrieved as required.
        Additionally, the work entailed defining and designing the automated process.
    </p>

    <h3>The Impact</h3>
    <p>With the help of The Casey Group, the documents now move through a systematic workflow that
        <ul>
            <li>Eliminates paper handling of the documnets</li>
            <li>Reduces errors</li>
            <li>Provides routing based on business rules</li>
            <li>Automates escalations for review and approval</li>
            <li>Reduces overall processing time</li>
            <li>Allowed processing to be centralized</li>
            <li>Integrates with other systems that rely on the documents and real time processing status</li>
        </ul>
        The system went live in early 2010 in a limited prototype rollout.
        It has now been expanded into all of the company's branch offices.

        Services: System Development and Legacy Modernization
    </h2>

    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <p>Our client is a major distributor and retailor of automotive parts.
        It supplies retailers and repair shops acorss the U.S. 
        Its core application is a real time networked system that fulfills online requests for parts by routing requests through the distribution channels in order to fulfill various sales order requests.
        <br>
        The company had begun an initiative to modernize and re-write the current application system to improve its overall performances and functionality.
        In order to do this, a decision was made to free up internal IT resources from maintaining and enhancing the existing system while the new development was in progress.
        Additionally, IT resources were to be freed up from normal day to day production bug fixing on the exisiting system.
    </p>

    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>To enable it to focus on its new development efforts, the client selected The Casey Group to manage some of their IT systems.
        <br>
        The Casey Group wastasksed with performing all system analysis, application development and production break fix.
        Part of the challenge was working with older technologies that were in use as well as having to become familiar with the client's internal code and business processes in a short period of time.
        <br>
        To help achieve this and to meet all requirements, The Casey Group's development team did a series of reverse engineering on the application using various tools and techniques.
        A mock production application was then setup to simulate the production environment an associated connections.
        The result of this process was extremly positive.
        The developers were able to respond within the agreed upen SLA's for production issues as well as respond to the various enhancement requests that were bring made by the business.
    </p>

    <h3>The Impact</h3>
    <p>The Casey Group's support of the client's legacy system ultimately allowed the company to successfully develop its new system and begin to rollout according to their growther plans.
        This contract ran for over a two-year period and The Casey Group has be preiodically contacted by the client for additional engagements.

    </h2>

    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <p>Our client is a major disributor and retailer of automotive parts.
        IT supplies retailers and maintenance shops accross the U.S. 
        They acquired a company that focused on supplying paint finishes to automotive shops.
        The acquired company was running the core inventory mamangement system on an AS400 / DB2 platform with an unsupported client software tehcnology of Delphi 5.0.
        Our client's enterprise platforms were not compatible with the acquired company's inventory management application int the client's enterprise, the application needed to be reworked so that it could integrate with the other internal systems.
    </p>

    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>The Casey Group's custom application development team was asled to develop the integration for the automotive inventory management system (AMI) and to add new functionality to the system.
        Based on the clients' specifications and our IT assessment, we researched the application and devised a structure that allowed the system to be brought in-house in a phased approach.
        A scaffolding approach using web serivces as the means to integrated was used.
        The database was first ported to an oracle platform which was the client's standard for the enterprise.
        We services were then created, which allowed the retailers and the internal client sales force applications to communicate wiht other critical intermal applications.
        The reduced risk of rewritting the front end, which would have significantly increased the time line and cost for integration.
    </p>

    <h3>The Impact</h3>
    <p>The Casey Group successfully integrated the acquired application inot the client's enterprise, which enabled it to proceed with the acqusition of the new buisness on time and within budget.
