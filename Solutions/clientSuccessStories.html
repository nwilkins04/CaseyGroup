    <h2>Fire and Security Firm (Fortune 500)
        <br>
        Service: Legacy Systems Management
    </h2>

    <h3>The Challenage</h3>
    <p>A leading fire and security firm that provides monitoring systems for the commercial and residential business markets wanted to focus its attention on the continues growth and development of its business.
        As a result, it wanted to use its internal IT resources for focusing on new initiatives and business development.
        <br>
        The company has an IBM mainframe and websphere environment.
        These environments run key strategic functions such as order to cash processing, sales management, accounts receivables, customer call center applications and document management processing.
    </p>

    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>The company chose The Casey Group to manage its IT systems, which enables the client to focus on their core businesses instead of IT.
        <br>
        This contract has specific Service Level Agreements (SLA's) that must be met, standard operating procedures to be developed and followed, and overall full production responsibility of the underlying system.
        The Casey Group is functioning as complete extension of the company's IT department and runs the company's contracted applications.
        From a system infrastructure standpoint, dedicated personnel ensure that the mainframe and servers are tuned for the systems running on them, and that infrastructure software is maintained.
        From an application perspective, The Casey Group is responsible for everything from systems analysis and development to full production control of the implemented code.
    </p>

    <h3>The Impact</h3>
    <p>This relationship has been successfully in place for over 9 years and has allowed the fire and security company to continually expand and grow its core business.
        The Casey Group is functining as a complete extension of the company's IT department and handles over 20 million invoices annually that produce over $2 billion in billing receivables.
