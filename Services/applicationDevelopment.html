    <p>In many cases, software packages will not provide the features and functionality that a compnay requires.
        The cost benefits that were originally assumed often vanish when the package requires modifications.
        In this situation, a custom solution may offer more beneifts and ROI.
        <br>
        The Casey Group specialized in custom software development and creates solutions that fit client specifications exactly.
        To ensure that oour clients experience successful projects taht are on time and within budget, we use methodologies within The Casey Way to manage development projects.
        <br>
        We consider your project characteristics, culture, and preferences and requires documentation when determining which methodologies will be selected.
        There will be constant communication throughout the engagement and you will have a well-managed and efficient project development process.
        <br>
        Key areas of focus include:
        <ul>
            <li> Customer Application Development</li>
            <li>Mobility Application Development</li>
            <li>Portal Applications</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Upon completion we conduct a Performance Evaluation on each application to determine:
        <ul>
            <li>Functionality</li>
            <li>Scalability</li>
            <li>Reliability</li>
