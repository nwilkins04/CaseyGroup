        <h3>Systems Integration</h3>

        <p>To mazimize returns from investents in exisiting and net IT systems, companies need well-intefrated systems.
            For many companies, integration is a critical challenge because of the different technologies, processes, platforms and other factors that have been implemented throughout the various sytem life cycles.
            Often, a complete re-write of the systems is not practical or cost effective.
            An integrated scheme that allows systems to work together (while new systems are introduced and old systems aer rewritten) may be the best option.    
            It enables companies to extend investments in existing systems and implement new technologies that are needed to remain competitive.
            <br>
            The Casey Group has extensive experience in systems integration and uses proven, practical approaches.
            Our system integration development processes follow one of The Casey Group's Metholodologies (CUP/CAM)  for managing projects development life cycles.
            <br>
