    <h1>Legacy System Modernization</h1>

    <p>Whether it is a custom-coded application with long-lost source code or mainframe-based program with a proprietary interface, your company probably has an important legacy application running in its data center. 
        This legacy application might perform an important or irreplaceable function.
        It might even be mission-critical but you need to consider how you introduce new technologies that are more efficiant and effective.
        <br>
        We have extensive experience with legacy systems and can help you determine how many of your critical applications are running legacy code, determine what knowledge is at risk, and even provide your current IT staff with legacy system training.
        <br>
        Legacy modernization projects focus on the re-engineering and moving of applications from one technology platform to another.
        In many cases it requires re-engineering the architetcture so that it is robust enough to handle the current as well as future business models. Some of the activities and methods used are:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Iterative development process for deliverables</li>
            <li>Scaffolding techniques to fuse new and old technologies and architectures</li>
            <li>Re-eningeering of the business process</li>
            <li>Architecting applications using a Services Oriented Architecture to allow for futher expansion and centralization of methods and services</li>
            <li>Infrastructure and system performace tuning</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
