    <h1>Methodologies</h1>

    <p>Here at The Casey Group, we blieve that there is no single process that can fit all needs.
        In fact, this is the reason why many methodologies fail.
        They are extended beond their intended boundaries and used even when the process doees not fit the charactistics of the projects.
        <br>
        While we select technologies and methodologies that best meet client requirements and budgets.
        We have developed two core frameworks that can be adapted based on project and client objectives.
        The choice of which framework to use takes into account multiple factors but can be summarized into three broad areas:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Project characteristcs and attributes</li>
            <li>Client culture within the organization</li>
            <li>Audit and the documentation requirements</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Our choice processes are based on current proven industry methodologies.
        The Casey Unified Process (CUP) is based on the Rational Unified Process (RUP), V Model and Feature Driven Development (FDD) methodology.
        The CUP methodology also has three levels of implementation to choose from, determined by project scope and complexity.
        <br>
        The Casey Agile Methology (CAM) is based on Agile Extreme Programing (XP) methodology and SCRUM management.
        <br>
        Along with basing the methods on proven industry methods, each method was modified/extended based on 20 years of project management experience with clients and delivering successful projects.
